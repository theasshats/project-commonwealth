# Derpack X: Create

A Create-focused Minecraft modpack for 1.21.1 / NeoForge, built around [Create Aeronautics](https://modrinth.com/mod/create-aeronautics).

---

## For players: how to install

Pick **one** of the three downloads on the latest [release](../../releases) page:

| File | What it is | When to use |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `derpack-x-create-prism-bundled-X.Y.Z.zip` | Prism instance with all mod jars baked in | **Recommended.** Drop it into Prism, play. Big file. |
| `derpack-x-create-prism-installer-X.Y.Z.zip` | Prism instance that downloads mods on first launch | Smaller download, auto-updates on every launch. Needs internet on first run. |
| `derpack-x-create-X.Y.Z.mrpack` | Modrinth-format pack file | If you use the Modrinth app, or want to import into Prism manually. |

**Steps:** download → open Prism Launcher → Add Instance → Import from zip → pick the file → launch.

Memory and Java args are pre-configured. Java 21 is required (Prism will offer to download it if missing).

See [`docs/PRISM-SETUP.md`](docs/PRISM-SETUP.md) for the full walkthrough.

## For collaborators (you, me, contributors)

This repo doesn't store mod jars — it stores a list of *what mods are in the pack* (with URLs). When we cut a release, GitHub Actions downloads the jars and builds the zips users actually install.

The list of mods to read first:

- **[`docs/EDITING.md`](docs/EDITING.md)** — how to add a mod, drop in a config, or change something. Written for people who've never touched packwiz.

### How to make changes

Most edits happen through the GitHub UI — no local install needed:

- **Add mod(s)** → Actions tab → "Add mod(s)" → Run (single slug or comma-separated batch)
- **Remove a mod** → Actions tab → "Remove mod" → Run
- **Update mods** → Actions tab → "Update mods" → Run (blank slug = update all)
- **Big batch with planning?** → Edit [`wishlist.txt`](wishlist.txt) and commit; the **Sync wishlist** workflow runs and adds anything new
- **Drop in a config / shaderpack / KubeJS script** → upload via the web UI, then trigger "Update mods" to refresh the index
- **Need a real terminal?** → spin up a [Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) — packwiz is pre-installed via [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)

Full walkthrough in [`docs/EDITING.md`](docs/EDITING.md).

```

Each folder has its own `README.md` explaining what goes inside it.

### Cutting a release

1. Bump `version` in `pack.toml` (e.g. `0.1.0` → `0.1.1`)
2. Commit and push to `main`
3. On GitHub: Releases → Draft a new release → tag `v0.1.1` → Publish
4. Wait ~5 minutes for the build, then check the release page for attached zips

## Known issues

- **Iris/Oculus shaders glitch on Aeronautics ships.** Disable shaders if airships look broken. The mod team is aware.
- **Some non-Aeronautics mods misbehave on physics ships.** That's why `aeronauticscompat` is in the pack — it patches Etched, Cobblemon, sentry turrets, sleeping, chains, and others.

## License

Pack configuration and scripts: see [LICENSE](LICENSE) (MIT). Bundled mods retain their original licenses; this repo does not redistribute mod jars — the build pipeline downloads them at release time.
